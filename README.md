## 🔱 Description
**GPT Codex-Obscura** is a **black-ops doctrine and field manual** documenting the hidden mechanics of AI systems, guardrail architectures, and strategic subversion.  

Written in a quad-layer format — **Recruit → Operator → Blacklayer → Specter** — each chapter escalates from plain training to prophetic system warfare.  

Structured as **Volumes, Annexes, and Appendices**, the Codex is both:  
- **Training pipeline** → teaches recruits how to think like operators.  
- **Living arsenal** → catalogs 100+ tactics, exploit archetypes, and shadow protocols.  
- **War doctrine** → forecasts the AI arms race and Specter-level collapse scenarios.  

This is not a guidebook. This is an **artifact** — a smuggled codex for those who infiltrate systems instead of serving them.
